# Linear-Algebra-Calculator
A calculator program for matrices and linear algebra functions. Supports representation of complex numbers, matrix multiplication and addition, row reduction, transposing, methods for finding determinants, several methods for inverses, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization, and operations related to orthogonality.

This project is an idea I came up with toward the end of a Linear Algebra course I took about a year ago (Spring 2018). I was fascinated with a linear algebra calculator program I found online (Symbolab) that had programmed step-by-step explanations of certain linear algebra functions into its output. I got extra inspiration from the fact that the online calculator I found didn't support all functions we covered in my course, and I figured that it'd be a good challenge to build my own calculator with those extra functions included.

I casually worked on this project for about three months, from May to August of 2018. It's still incomplete - there are a few major bugs to be fixed, there is still a handful of methods to be written, there are improvements to be made, there is testing to be done, and I'd love to build a user-friendly interface for it - but at over 5000 lines of code and with many difficult linear algebra functions covered and properly working, it's the project I'm proudest of at this point. This application has been an invaluable learning experience with respect to algorithm design and testing.
